Commenting Terraform Code

To make our code easier to understand for others who might want to contribute we may want to add a comment to explain what a resource or a particular code block is doing. 
The Terraform language supports three different syntaxes for comments:

# begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.

// also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to #.

/* and */ are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines.

     1: Add Single Line Comment to Terraform Configuration
     2: Add Multi-Line Comment to Terraform Configuration
